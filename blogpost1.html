                    <p>ewwwwww...
                        The lack of basic functions like an inbuilt terminal and syntax highlighting makes it extremely ahrd to use. 
                        Even worse is the fact that most programmers have to start here, at the hard end, and once they're good enough, get to use the easier tools??

                    <br>
                    <h4>VSCode</h4>
                    <img src="1024px-Visual_Studio_Code_1.35_icon.svg.png" alt="VSCode" width="30" height="30">
                    <p>VSCode is my favourite IDE for begineers. It features basic functions like a debugging mode, ability to run without compiling, and sybtax highlighting and terminaml. 
                    However, there are things that can be a time and even life saver. Finishing a line of code using predictive syntax for you? Saves me hours through finishing every print() ever.
                    </p>
                    <p>Its compatibility with most languages, from the common HTML and JavaScript, to more obscure ones like Ruby, and all forms of C, makes it my favourite choice. However.... </p>
                    <br>
                    <h4>XCode</h4>
                    <p>XCode is a Mac only software. For developing mobile apps, its the king. Easy simulation, distribution, and management of the app and its updates make it the easy choice for the mobile developer.</p>
                    <br>

                    <p>I haven't used many more notable IDEs but many have their own unique features. </p>
